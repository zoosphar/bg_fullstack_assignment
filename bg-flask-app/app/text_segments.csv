Notes to the Financial Statements,104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
36. Principal Accounting Policies,104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Basis of consolidation (i) The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, and the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(ii) A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration. The Group recognises the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary. In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss in profit and loss. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. When control over a previous subsidiary is lost, any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured at fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"All material intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(iii) An associate is an entity, not being a subsidiary or a joint venture, over which the Group exercises significant influence. A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Associates and joint ventures are included on the equity basis of accounting.,104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates and joint ventures.,104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
(iv) Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of the results and net assets of subsidiaries and their associates and joint ventures not attributable to the Group.,104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(v) The results of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included or excluded from their effective dates of acquisition or disposal, respectively. The results of entities other than subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included to the extent of dividends received when the right to receive such dividend is established.",104,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates.,105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, together with all other monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies, are translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Results expressed in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average rates of exchange ruling during the year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.",105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and of financial instruments which are designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under exchange reserves. On the disposal of these investments, such exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss. All other exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss.",105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity after 1st January 2003 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.,105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the units may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment annually.",105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Intangible assets (i) Goodwill represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisition-date fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the net identifiable assets at the acquisition date. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit and loss. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in investment in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss.",105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The profit or loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is stated after deducting the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.",105,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Intangible assets continued (ii) Other intangible assets, consisting of trademarks and computer software, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation.",106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Tangible assets and depreciation Freehold properties comprised land and buildings. Freehold land is stated at cost less any impairment. No depreciation is provided on freehold land as it is deemed to have an indefinite life. Buildings on freehold and leasehold land are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Other tangible assets are stated at cost less amounts provided for depreciation and impairment.,106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives are as follows:,106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Where the carrying amount of a tangible asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.",106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The profit or loss on disposal of tangible assets is recognised by reference to their carrying amounts.,106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.",106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Lease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to lease and non-lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices. For property leases where the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and immaterial non-lease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component.",106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"As a lessee, the Group enters into property leases for use as retail stores, distribution centres and offices. The Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement dates, that is the dates the underlying assets are available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes amounts of the initial measurement of lease liabilities recognised, lease payments made at or before the commencement dates less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and restoration costs. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and the lease terms.",106,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Leases continued The Group also has interests in leasehold land for use in its operations. Lump sum payments are made upfront to acquire these land interests from their previous registered owners or governments in the jurisdictions where the land is located. There are no ongoing payments to be made under the term of the land leases, other than insignificant lease renewal costs or payments based on rateable value set by the relevant government authorities. These payments are stated at cost and are amortised over the term of the lease which includes the renewal period if the lease can be renewed by the Group without significant cost.",107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease terms. Lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.",107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased by the interest costs on the lease liabilities and decreased by lease payments made.",107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term, or there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, or there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual guarantee, or there is a change arising from the reassessment of whether the Group will be reasonably certain to exercise an extension or a termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.",107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e. US$5,000 or less) and short-term leases. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Lease payments associated with these leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit and loss over the lease term.",107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Lease liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities unless payments are due within 12 months from the balance sheet date.,107,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Investments The Group’s investments are measured at fair value through profit and loss. The classification is based on the management’s business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics.,108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Equity investments are measured at fair value with fair value gains and losses recognised in profit and loss. Transaction costs of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss are expensed in profit and loss.,108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Investments are classified as non-current assets. All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the investments.",108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Stocks Stocks, which principally comprise goods held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost basis and comprises purchase price less rebates. A stock provision is recognised when the net realisable value from sale of the stock is estimated to be lower than the carrying value.",108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Debtors Trade and other debtors, excluding derivative financial instruments, are measured at amortised cost except where the effect of discounting would be immaterial. Provision for impairment is established by considering potential financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in arriving at operating profit. When a debtor is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amount previously written off are credited to profit and loss.",108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Debtors with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified under non-current assets. Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks, and cash and bank balances, net of bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included in current borrowings. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligations can be made. Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such plans will be carried out by either starting to implement them or announcing their main features to those affected by it. Borrowings and borrowing costs Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.",108,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Current and deferred tax The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.",109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.,109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.",109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Provision for deferred tax is made on the revaluation of certain non-current assets and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax bases. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.",109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Employee benefits (i) Pension obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds.",109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Pension accounting costs for defined benefit plans are assessed using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the costs of providing pensions are charged to profit and loss spreading the regular cost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, who carry out a full valuation of major plans every year. The pension obligations are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability. Plan assets are measured at fair value.",109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.,109,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Food – Convenience,10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Disruption caused by the pandemic impacted customer traffic into our Convenience stores, resulting in a 4% reduction in sales to US$2.1 billion. Operating profit decreased by 31% to US$57 million, driven primarily by a combination of the shortfall in sales and a sales mix shift towards lower product margin categories.",10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Health and Beauty,10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Total sales for the Health and Beauty Division reduced by 35% to US$2.0 billion as the pandemic impacted customer traffic across our key markets. In North Asia, enforced border closures have led to a virtual elimination of tourism, most notably from the Chinese mainland, which has significantly impacted our Mannings business in Hong Kong and Macau. The resultant decline in sales performance was the primary cause of a significant decrease in operating profit from US$296 million in 2019 to US$66 million.",10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Faced with challenging trading conditions, the Group is focusing on ensuring that its customer value proposition – from the perspective of pricing, stores and channel to market - remains relevant and competitive. Price investment campaigns have been introduced across our key markets with encouraging results so far. The Group is also managing costs appropriately.",10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Home Furnishings,10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"In Home Furnishings, sales for IKEA increased by 9% in the year, as new store openings and strong e-commerce growth offset pandemic related disruption. Operating profit increased by US$28 million to US$71 million, due to a combination of new store profit contribution, lower cost of goods, strong cost controls, reduced pre-opening expenses for new stores and government support.",10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"The Group’s share of underlying results in Yonghui grew from US$23 million in 2019 to US$29 million in 2020, primarily due to strong sales growth. Dairy Farm’s share of underlying results in Robinsons Retail fell by 5% to US$14 million. The financial performance of Robinsons Retail in the year was impacted by government restrictions on movement due to the pandemic, particularly with respect to its discretionary formats.",10,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Employee benefits continued (ii) Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled employee share option schemes. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share options or the share awards in respect of options or awards granted after 7th November 2002 is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options or share awards granted as determined on the grant date. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to become exercisable and the number of share awards which will be vested free of payment. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss.",110,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Non-current assets and disposal group held for sale Non-current assets and disposal group are classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amounts are expected to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Once classified as held for sale, the assets are no longer amortised or depreciated.",110,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Derivative financial instruments The Group only enters into derivative financial instruments in order to hedge underlying exposures and not as speculative investments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (‘fair value hedge’), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the foreign currency risk on a firm commitment (‘cash flow hedge’).",110,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.",110,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in profit and loss, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance costs, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit and loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to profit and loss over the residual period to maturity.",110,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Derivative financial instruments continued Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under hedging reserves. Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in profit and loss. Where the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the deferred gains and losses are included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit and loss as the hedged item affects profit and loss. Otherwise, amounts deferred in hedging reserves are transferred to profit and loss in the same periods during which the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects profit and loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in hedging reserves at that time remains in the hedging reserves and is recognised in profit and loss when the committed or forecasted transaction occurs. When a committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in hedging reserves is immediately transferred to profit and loss.",111,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group’s risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules in IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are recognised immediately in profit and loss.",111,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The fair value of derivatives which are designated and qualified as effective hedges are classified as non-current assets or liabilities if the remaining maturities of the hedged assets or liabilities are greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.,111,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.",111,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

The weighted average number excludes the shares held by the Trustee under the Share-based Long-term Incentive Plans. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit attributable to shareholders is adjusted for the effects of the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, and the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the number of shares which are deemed to be issued for no consideration under the share-based long-term incentive plans based on the average share price during the year.",112,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"The income is recognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the income earned relates to stocks which are held by the Group at period ends, the income is included within the cost of those stocks, and recognised in cost of sales upon sale of those stocks. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade debtors or trade creditors, depending on the right of offset.",112,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The key types of buying income which the Group receives include:,112,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
– Discounts and incentives relate to individual unit sales. – Sales volume-based incentives based on achieving certain purchases on promotion for an event or a period. – Conditional incentives subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Group. – Fixed amounts agreed with suppliers for supporting in-store activity.,112,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

37. Standards and Amendments Issued But Not Yet Effective,113,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
A number of amendments effective for accounting periods beginning after 2020 have been published and will be adopted by the Group from their effective dates. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of these standard and amendments but expects the adoption will not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The more important amendments are set out below.,113,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(i) Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (effective from 1st January 2021) provides practical expedients as a result of the reform which affect the measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, and a number of reliefs for hedging relationships. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2021, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.",113,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(ii) Amendment to IFRS 9: ‘Fees in the ’10 per cent’ Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities’ (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies the requirement to derecognise the original financial liability and recognise a new financial liability where there is an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instrument with substantially different terms. The amendment clarifies that the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms using the original effective interest rate, including any fees paid net of any fees received, is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. The Group will apply the amendment from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.",113,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(iii) Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies that for the purpose of assessing whether a contract is onerous, the cost of fulfilling the contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.",113,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Financial risk factors The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group’s treasury function co-ordinates financial risk management policies and their implementation on a group-wide basis. The Group’s treasury policies are designed to manage the financial impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and to minimise the Group’s financial risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options as appropriate for hedging transactions and managing the Group’s assets and liabilities in accordance with the Group’s financial risk management policies. Financial derivative contracts are executed between third party banks and the Group’s entity that is directly exposed to the risk being hedged. Hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred into the cash flow hedge reserve through other comprehensive income and will be recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item affects profit and loss. In general, the volatility in profit or loss can be reduced by applying hedge accounting.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"For hedges of foreign currency purchases, the Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been and expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated for hedges of foreign currency purchases, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, effective economic relationship existed between the swaps and the loans.",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Hedge ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed using the same principles as for hedges of foreign currency purchases. It may occur due to:,114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
(i) The credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan;,114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
(ii) Differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans; and,114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(iii) The effects of the forthcoming reforms to IBOR, because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on the hedged item (the floating-rate debt) and the hedging instrument (the interest rate swap used to hedge the debt).",114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The ineffectiveness during 2020 in relation to interest rate swaps was not material while there was no interest rate swap in 2019.,114,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Financial risk factors continued (i) Market risk Foreign exchange risk Entities within the Group are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, net investments in foreign operations and net monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.",115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options in a consistent manner to hedge firm and anticipated foreign exchange commitments and manage foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities and the profit and loss account of the Group.,115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency. There are no significant monetary balances held by Group companies at 31st December 2020 that are denominated in a non-functional currency. Differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency are not taken into consideration.,115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. These exposures are managed partly by using natural hedges that arise from offsetting interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, and partly through fixed rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps. The Group monitors interest rate exposure on a regular basis by currency and business unit, taking into consideration proposed financing and hedging arrangements. The Group’s guideline is to maintain 40% to 60% of its long-term non-working capital gross borrowings in fixed rate instruments. At 31st December 2020, the Group’s fixed rate borrowings were 9% on total borrowings, with an average tenor of 0.2 year. At 31st December 2019, the Group had no outstanding fixed rate borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings after taking into account hedging transactions is set out in note 19.",115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will impact cash flows arising from variable rate financial instruments. Borrowings at floating rates therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by entering into interest rate swaps for a maturity of up to three years. Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rate to fixed rate. Details of interest rate swaps are set out in note 30.,115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial asset or liability and derivative financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group manages its fair value interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fixed rate to floating rate, to maintain the Group’s fixed rate instruments within the Group’s guideline.",115,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Financial Risk Management continued Financial risk factors continued (i) Market risk continued Interest rate risk continued At 31st December 2020, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit after tax would have been US$7.7 million (2019: US$9.2 million) higher/lower, and hedging reserves would have been US$2.5 million lower/higher (2019: no change), as a result of fair value changes to cash flow hedges. The sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change in interest rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to the exposure to interest rate risk for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments in existence at that date. The 100 basis point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in those interest rates which have the most impact on the Group, specifically the Hong Kong, United States and Malaysian rates, over the period until the next annual balance sheet date. In the case of effective fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedged items caused by interest rate movements balance out in the profit and loss account against changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments, the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks. As a consequence, they are included in the calculation of profit after tax sensitivities. Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that were designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge to hedge payment fluctuations resulting from interest rate movements affect the hedging reserves and are therefore taken into consideration in the equity-related sensitivity calculations.",116,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
(ii) Credit risk The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to deposits with banks and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. The Group has credit policies in place and the exposures to these credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.,116,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group manages its deposits with banks and transactions involving derivative financial instruments by monitoring credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios of counterparties, and limiting the aggregate risk to any individual counterparty. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Similarly, transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with banks with sound credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios. In developing countries it may be necessary to deposit money with banks that have a lower credit rating, however, the Group only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties which have credit ratings of at least investment grade. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.",116,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Sales to customers are made in cash or by major credit cards. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet after deducting any impairment allowance.,116,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(iii) Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management includes managing the profile of debt maturities and funding sources, maintaining sufficient cash and ensuring the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Group’s ability to fund its existing and prospective debt requirements is managed by maintaining diversified funding sources with adequate committed funding lines from high quality lenders, and by monitoring rolling short-term forecasts of the Group’s cash and gross debt on the basis of expected cash flows. Long-term cash flows are projected to assist with the Group’s long-term debt financing plans. In addition, the Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme, which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirement on a daily basis.",116,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Financial risk factors continued (iii) Liquidity risk continued At 31st December 2020, total available borrowing facilities amounted to US$3,091.4 million (2019: US$2,344.0 million), of which US$2,074.7 million (2019: US$1,452.8 million) were committed facilities. A total of US$1,094.3 million (2019: US$1,122.2 million) from both committed and uncommitted facilities was drawn down. Undrawn committed facilities, in the form of revolving credit facilities, totalled US$1,319.0 million (2019: US$462.2 million).",117,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The following table analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities, net-settled derivative financial liabilities and gross-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.

38. Financial Risk Management continued,118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Capital management The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern whilst seeking to maximise benefits to shareholders and other stakeholders. Capital is equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.,118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, by taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase Company shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.",118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group monitors capital on the basis of the Group’s consolidated gearing ratio and consolidated interest cover. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and bank balances. Interest cover is calculated as the sum of underlying operating profit, before the deduction of depreciation and impairment charges of right-of-use assets, net of actual lease payments, and share of results of associates and joint ventures, divided by net financing charges excluding interest on lease liabilities. The Group does not have a defined gearing ratio or interest cover benchmark or range.",118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Fair value estimation (i) Financial instruments that are measured at fair value For financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the balance sheet, the corresponding fair value measurements are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:",118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
(a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (‘quoted prices in active markets’) The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted prices in active markets at the balance sheet date.,118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(b) Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (‘observable current market transactions’) The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined using rates quoted by the Group’s bankers at the balance sheet date. The rates for interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market interest rates and foreign exchange rates.",118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The fair values of unlisted equity investments, mainly include club debentures, are determined using prices quoted by brokers at the balance sheet date.",118,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Fair value estimation continued (i) Financial instruments that are measured at fair value continued (c) Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (‘unobservable inputs’) The fair values of other unlisted equity investments are determined using valuation techniques by reference to observable current market transactions or the market prices of the underlying investments with certain degree of entity specific estimates or discounted cash flow by projecting the cash inflows from these investments.,119,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year. The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value measured by observable current market transactions.,119,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(ii) Financial instruments that are not measured at fair value The fair values of current debtors, cash and bank balances, current creditors, current borrowings and current lease liabilities are assumed to approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.",119,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The fair values of long-term borrowings are based on market prices or are estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates. The fair values of non-current lease liabilities are estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.,119,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Notes to the Financial Statements,122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
39. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements,122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable according to circumstances and conditions available. The existing and potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered when applying estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial statements, including the Group’s assessment of impairment of assets. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, the actual results may differ from these accounting estimates.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses are discussed below.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The initial accounting on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entities. The fair values of tangible assets and right-of-use assets are determined by independent valuers by reference to market prices or present value of expected net cash flows from the assets. Any changes in the assumptions used and estimates made in determining the fair values, and management’s ability to measure reliably the contingent liabilities of the acquired entity will impact the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"On initial acquisition or acquisition of further interests in an entity, an assessment of the level of control or influence exercised by the Group is required. For entities where the Group has a shareholding of less than 50%, an assessment of the Group’s level of voting rights, board representation and other indicators of influence is performed to consider whether the Group has de facto control, requiring consolidation of that entity, or significant influence, requiring classification as an associate, or joint control, requiring classification as a joint venture.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Leases Liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets arising from leases are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rates implicit in the leases, or if that rate cannot be readily determinable, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group applies the incremental borrowing rate with reference to the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term as that of the lease, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in the country where it is located.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Lease payments to be made during the lease term will be included in the measurement of a lease liability. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, the Group considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the options impacts the lease terms, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised.",122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Pension obligations The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.,122,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

39. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements continued,123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Pension obligations continued The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligations.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.,123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Impairment of assets The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives suffered any impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use, calculated on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. Changing the key assumptions, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the value-in-use calculations.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Provision of deferred tax follows the way management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related assets or liabilities, which the management may expect to recover through use, sale or combination of both. Accordingly, deferred tax will be calculated at income tax rate, capital gains tax rate or combination of both.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Recognition of deferred tax assets, which principally relate to tax losses, depends on the management’s expectation of future taxable profit that will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised. The outcome of their actual utilisation may be different.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Buying income The Group receives buying income, including supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, which are deducted from cost of sales on an accrual basis. Management is required to make estimates in determining the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract and the timing of recognition.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
There is limited estimation involved in recognising income for fixed amounts agreed with suppliers.,123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"In 2020, the Group recognised a charge in underlying profit for the reversal of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years. The Group has assessed the impact of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years on the consolidated financial statements and determined that the impact was not material to the consolidated financial statements of any prior financial years and therefore did not require a prior year restatement. The amount has been recorded through underlying results.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Non-trading items The Group uses underlying business performance in its internal financial reporting to distinguish between the underlying profits and non-trading items. The identification of non-trading items requires judgement by management, but follows the consistent methodology as set out in the Group’s accounting policies.",123,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Report on the audit of the financial statements,124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Opinion In our opinion, Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited’s Group (‘the Group’) financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):",124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31st December 2020 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; • have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’); and • have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda).,124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st December 2020; the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies (‘the Principal Accounting Policies’).",124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Certain required disclosures have been presented in the Corporate Governance section, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These disclosures are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.",124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.,124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Independence We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the Financial Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.",124,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Audit scope • A full scope audit was performed on seven entities including six subsidiaries and one associate, Maxim’s. • These entities, together with procedures performed on central functions and at the Group level, accounted for 89% of the Group’s revenue, 86% of the Group’s profit before tax, and 82% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax.",125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Key audit matters • Carrying value of investment in Robinsons Retail Holdings Inc. (‘Robinsons Retail’) • Buying income • IT environment • Impairment of assets in PT Hero • Impact of COVID-19,125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.",125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.",125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to, but were not limited to, the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda), the Listing Rules, tax regulations, employment regulation, health and safety regulation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant reporting component teams, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda).",125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
123,125,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Independent Auditors’ Report,126,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to the posting of inappropriate journal entries and management bias in accounting estimates and judgements. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:",126,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"• Gaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industries in which its businesses operate, and considering the risk of any acts by the Group which may be contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. • Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; • Understanding the results of whistleblowing procedures and related investigations. We focused on known and suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and company financial statements, including, but were not limited to, the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda), the Listing Rules, tax legislation, employment regulation, health and safety regulation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant reporting component teams. • Review of reporting component auditors’ work, including any matters reported by component auditors’ relating to non-compliance with laws and regulations or fraud; • Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In particular, in relation to the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures, the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets, and recognition of buying income (see related key audit matters below); • We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals, and evaluated whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.",126,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",126,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",126,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"As at 31st December 2020, the carrying value of the Group’s 20% investment in its associate, Robinsons Retail, was higher than its fair value based on its prevailing market share price.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Management undertook an impairment assessment, as required by accounting standards as there was an indicator of impairment.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"There is inherent estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of the carrying value of the investment as significant judgements are required by management in preparing their value-in-use models, particularly management’s view on key internal inputs and external market conditions which impact future cash flows, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We focused on the carrying value of the Group’s investment in Robinsons Retail due to the significant judgements and estimates involved to determine whether the carrying value of the investment was supportable.,127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
How our audit addressed the key audit matter,127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We assessed the inherent risk of material misstatement by considering the degree of estimation uncertainty and the judgement involved in determining the assumptions to be applied. We have understood and reviewed management’s impairment assessment process, including what indicators of impairment had been identified and the appropriateness of the valuation model used, including the assessment of the future impact of COVID-19. As we identified a heightened risk of impairment we performed the following procedures.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We benchmarked and challenged key assumptions in management’s valuation model used to determine recoverable amount against market data. This included whether the assumptions of projected cash flows of the business, the long-term growth rate and the discount rate were appropriate, using our knowledge and experience.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We tested the discounted cash flow model used in the assessment, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results and agreed the figures used with the detailed management approved budgets to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the model.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Our challenge focused particularly on the discount rate and long-term growth rate used. With the support of our valuations specialists, we compared the discount rates used with the range of typical discount rates used in similar businesses and, considered whether management had incorporated all relevant macro-economic and country-specific factors, as well as those specific to Robinsons Retail, in determining its discount rate.",127,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

How our audit addressed the key audit matter,128,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"For the growth rate we assessed whether management had considered macro-economic and country-specific factors specific to the relevant businesses, including the future impact of COVID-19. We also compared the rate used with the range of growth rates used by similar businesses.",128,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We tested management’s historical estimation accuracy by comparing previous projected growth rates to the actual growth achieved. Where differences were identified we understood management’s rationale and the evidence, such as actual recent performance, to support management’s estimates.",128,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We evaluated the sensitivity analysis performed by management and performed our independent sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions above and considered a range of alternative outcomes to determine the sensitivity of the valuation model to changes in assumptions.,128,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Overall, we found that the judgements and estimates made by management to determine the discount rate, long-term growth rate and the cash flows used in the valuation model were reasonable.",128,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and agreed disclosures in the financial statements to the model tested and the assumptions applied in the model.

Buying income,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Refer to note 36 (Principal Accounting Policies) and note 39 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) to the financial statements.,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group has arrangements with suppliers whereby volume-based discounts and incentives, promotional and marketing incentives and various other rebates and discounts are earned in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. As such, the Group recognises a net deduction from cost of sales as a result of amounts receivable from suppliers.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The individual supplier arrangements in place across the Group vary in nature. The majority of buying income is driven by volume-based measures or event-driven schemes, with the remainder being ad-hoc and promotional buying income.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Buying income is material to the financial statements and given the types of buying income arrangements as well as various performance criteria which differ by suppliers, we identified buying income as a key audit matter.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The level of judgement in each category of buying income is noted below:,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Volume-based income,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Volume-based rebates are generally driven by achieving purchase volume targets set with individual suppliers for specific products over a pre-set period of time. In instances where the rebate agreement does not fully coincide with the period-end, the key judgement that we focused on was the estimate of expected purchase volumes in the period covered by the rebate agreement.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Ad-hoc and promotional income,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The remainder of the Group’s buying income is associated with ad-hoc and promotional income. The nature of this income and the manner in which it is recognised varies depending on the nature of the agreement with the individual supplier. The income is earned as the relevant performance criteria are met. Due to the significant number of transactions and individual agreements and the potential for manual calculations, we focused effort on assessing the appropriateness of amounts recognised. Our focus was on the underlying agreements associated with the income earned, and assessing whether the income recorded was in accordance with those agreements.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
How our audit addressed the key audit matter,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We gained an understanding of and evaluated the key controls in place within the buying income process and tested those controls in certain components of the business. We performed a detailed analytical review of buying income by type and location to identify whether there were any unusual trends were present.,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"On a sample basis: • we traced the reconciliation of supplier deductions or payments recognised in the income statement to cash receipts or supplier contracts; • we selected amounts recognised in debtors and creditors and agreed the amounts to supporting documentation. Where buying income amounts were offset against outstanding amounts payable to suppliers we assessed whether there was a right to offset, based on the contractual terms with suppliers; • we assessed whether the performance criteria of the items selected had been met and where buying income amounts were estimated, that there was appropriate supporting evidence in determining those estimates; • we assessed the appropriateness of manual journal entries and adjustments associated with buying income by tracing them to supporting documentation; and • we assessed supplier dispute logs and management’s supplier statement reconciliations to determine whether material disputes or disagreements with suppliers existed. Where significant disputes or disagreements existed, we understood the nature of these disputes through discussions with management and obtained documentation to assess whether the amounts recognised by management were reasonable.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Overall, we found the amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of buying income to be supportable.",129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the buying income in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and consider the disclosures to be appropriate.,129,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Five strategic imperatives 1) Growth in China 7-Eleven South China opened over 200 additional new stores during the year despite the challenges of movement restrictions.

Subsequently, when movement restrictions became less severe, regulations prohibiting the sale of Ready-to-Eat products impacted sales recovery. Despite the challenges posed by trading conditions, strong execution of product innovation and promotions led to a significant improvement in sales in the second half of the year. During the year, 7-Eleven South China began a project to transform its legacy IT systems with a new end-to-end agile IT solution, to support both an improved customer shopping experience and its future growth ambitions.",12,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Mannings China’s sales performance was impacted significantly in the first quarter as restrictions on movement led to reduced traffic. However, the business reported improving like-for-like sales trends throughout 2020. Mannings China continues to execute its space optimisation plan with greater focus around the Greater Bay Area, where Mannings has stronger brand awareness and can leverage the existing scale of 7-Eleven. E-commerce growth continues to be strong, with penetration now over double digits.",12,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

The Group has recognised asset impairment charges of US$103 million in relation to the Indonesian Grocery Retail business for the year ended 31st December 2020 following a store performance review.,130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"These costs comprise of US$39 million relating to the impairment of intangible assets and US$64 million for the impairment of tangible assets, impairment of right-of-use assets, redundancy provisions, and other provisions.",130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"As required by accounting standards, management performed a detailed impairment assessment of the intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets having identified impairment indicators arising from the financial performance of the Indonesian Grocery Retail business.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter,130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We assessed the inherent risk of material misstatement by considering the degree of estimation uncertainty and the judgement involved in determining assumptions to be applied. We have understood and reviewed management’s impairment assessment process for assessing the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets, including the identification of indicators of impairment and appropriateness of the valuation models used, including the assessment of the future impact of COVID-19.",130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We have considered and scrutinised management’s store performance review for the Indonesian Grocery Retail business.,130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"On a sample basis, we agreed the carrying value of tangible assets and right-of-use assets that were assessed for impairment to underlying financial records.",130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We tested the discounted cash flow models used by management to determine the amount of intangible asset, tangible asset and right-of-use asset impairment required. We assessed the cash flow forecasts by comparing historical budgeted performance to actual results, agreeing the financial information used to the Board approved budget, and checked the accuracy of the calculations.",130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used by management in the models by agreeing key inputs, such as the cash flow forecasts for individual stores, to the detailed budget approved by the Board. In addition, on a sample basis, we agreed the inputs used in the calculations to the underlying lease contracts.",130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We assessed the key inputs and assumptions used by management in calculating the redundancy and other provisions with reference to actual historical performance and underlying contractual agreements. We evaluated whether the assumptions were appropriate based on the evidence available.,130,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

IT environment,131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The Group is heavily reliant on its IT infrastructure and systems for the daily operations of its business.,131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
We focused on IT systems as the systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels of standardisation and integration between new and legacy IT systems. The systems are vital to the ongoing operations of the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process.,131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
How our audit addressed the key audit matter,131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We considered that the key assumptions used, and calculations prepared by management to determine the intangible asset, tangible asset and right-of-use asset impairments, redundancy provisions and other provisions to be supportable based on available evidence.",131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets and the other provisions made in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and agreed disclosures in the financial statements to the models tested and the assumptions applied in those models. We are satisfied that appropriate disclosure has been made.",131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We updated our understanding of the IT environment through discussions with management and walked-through the key financial processes to understand the relevant IT systems which were integral to the Group’s controls over financial reporting. These procedures allowed us to determine which IT systems, processes and controls to rely upon.",131,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Impact of COVID-19,132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the performance of the Group. The extent of the negative impact of the pandemic on future trading performance is difficult to predict. Therefore, there is inherent uncertainty in determining the impact of the pandemic on certain aspects of the financial statements.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The key impact of COVID-19 on the financial statements are: • Management’s assessment of the carrying values of the Group’s goodwill in subsidiaries and the carrying values of its investments in associates and joint ventures as a result of a reduction to the valuations at the year end, in part arising due to the impact of COVID-19 on the underlying businesses, as described in the related key audit matter above. In particular, we focused on the carrying value of goodwill held in respect of PT Hero and the carrying value of the Group’s investment in its associate, Robinsons Retail. • The budgets and models supporting the tangible assets and right-of-use assets reflect management’s best estimate of the impact of COVID-19. The assumptions applied in this analysis have been determined internally, but they incorporate other third-party data sources where relevant. • The models and related assumptions that underpin management’s going concern assessment. Having considered the impact of COVID-19 on liquidity models, management has concluded that the Group remains a going concern, and that there is no material uncertainty in respect of this conclusion. Management’s way of working, including the operation of controls, has been impacted by COVID-19 as a result of a large number of staff working remotely.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Our procedures in respect of impairment assessments related to carrying value of the Group’s investment in Robinsons Retail and impairment of the assets in PT Hero are covered in the related key audit matters above.,132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We performed procedures to assess the recoverability of tangible assets and right-of-use assets. Where these involved management’s impairment assessment, we assessed the appropriateness of valuation models used and assumptions applied.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"With the support of our valuation specialists, we benchmarked and challenged key assumptions in management’s valuation models used to determine recoverable amounts against market data. This included whether assumptions of projected cash flows of stores, long-term growth rates and discount rates were appropriate taking into account the impact of COVID-19, using our knowledge and experience, for the tangible assets and right-of-use assets under review.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We tested the discounted cash flow models used in the assessments, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the models. We performed an independent sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and considered a range of alternative outcomes to determine the sensitivity of the valuation models to changes in assumptions.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Where the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (‘CGU’), we checked the calculation of the impairment charge recognised.",132,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Our conclusions in respect of going concern are set out separately within this report.",133,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We performed additional procedures to assess any control implications arising from the impact of COVID-19, including inquiries with respect to the operation of IT and business process controls, and whether there has been any impact on the Group. We instructed our component teams to perform additional procedures to understand if there were any changes to management’s planned operation of controls or monitoring activities.",133,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industries in which it operates.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group’s accounting processes are structured around finance functions, which are responsible for their own accounting records and controls, which in turn report financial information to the Group’s finance function in Hong Kong to enable them to prepare consolidated financial statements.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by members of the Group engagement team or by component auditors from member firms within the PwC Network operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The Group engagement team was involved in the significant reporting entities in scope for Group reporting during the audit cycle through a combination of meetings and conference calls. Due to the current restrictions on travel and social distancing measures, enacted as a response to COVID-19, the lead Group audit partner and other senior team members were involved throughout the year through the regular use of conference calls and other forms of communication to direct and oversee the audit, including the remote review of the work of component teams.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"A full scope audit was performed on seven entities including six subsidiaries and one associate, Maxim’s. These entities, together with procedures performed on central functions and at the Group level (on the consolidation and other areas of significant judgement), accounted for 89% of the Group’s revenue, 86% of the Group’s profit before tax, and 82% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We set an overall Group materiality level of US$18.5 million (2019: US$19.6 million). This was based upon 5% of the Group’s consolidated three-year average underlying profit before tax for the years ended 31st December 2018, 31st December 2019 and 31st December 2020. In arriving at this judgement we had regard to the fact that underlying profit is an important financial indicator of the Group.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of overall materiality allocated across components was US$1.9 million to US$18.0 million.",134,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$13.8 million.",135,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was appropriate.",135,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$925,000 (2019: US$1.0 million), other than classifications within the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account or Consolidated Balance Sheet, which were only reported above US$18.5 million.

"Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.",135,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",136,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations.

"The Dairy Farm Group (Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries together known as the ‘Group’) understands the value of good corporate governance to long-term sustainable success and attaches importance to the corporate stability that strong governance brings, as well as the opportunities that result from it being part of the Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited (‘Jardine Matheson’) group.",139,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group is committed to high standards of governance. The system of governance it has adopted has been developed over many years by the members of the Jardine Matheson group which both the Group and its stakeholders regard as appropriate to the nature of its business and the long-term strategy it pursues in its Asian markets, and is tailored to the Group’s size, ownership structure, complexity and breadth of businesses. It enables the Company to benefit from Jardine Matheson’s strategic guidance and professional expertise, while at the same time ensuring that the independence of the Board is respected and clear operational accountability rests with the Company’s executive management teams. Having an effective corporate governance framework supports the Board in the delivery of the Group’s strategy and supports long-term sustainable growth.",139,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Wellcome Hong Kong reported double-digit like-for-like sales growth in 2020, driven by a trend towards eating-at-home, greater focus on fresh quality, strong in-store execution and enhanced pricing.

"However, disruption caused by the pandemic has adversely impacted performance for other banners in Hong Kong, particularly Mannings and 7-Eleven. The virtual elimination of tourist traffic through border closures has had a significant impact on Mannings’ sales and profitability, and the business has focused strongly on investment in value to maximise appeal to the Hong Kong customers. Performance has been encouraging so far, with the price initiative underpinning relative improvement in both volume and profitability. 7-Eleven’s performance was also adversely impacted by reduced local foot traffic, particularly in MTR locations following business and government advice to encourage employees to work from home.",13,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

In October, Dairy Farm deepened its partnership with Robinsons Retail by combining its interests in Rose Pharmacy with Robinsons Retail’s subsidiary Southstar Drug.

"4) Building capability The Group has balanced internal promotions with the introduction of external capability, and the change in leadership within the organisation has brought depth of experience and thinking to Dairy Farm. It has also led to a cultural shift within the Group in terms of our ways of working. In turn, this has supported the resilience of the business and our ability to adapt to rapidly evolving challenges posed by the pandemic, including different and changing approaches by governments in each of the regions in which we operate. Decisive action was taken to ensure joint co-ordination of: resourcing to support fluctuations in trading hours; inventory procurement to ensure stability of supply; supply of health and hygiene products for all team members; and clear, regular, consistent communications updates to all team members. One outcome of strong execution in this area has been that Dairy Farm has been at the forefront of ensuring our people’s safety.",15,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

We are halfway through that plan and there is much still to do. Despite all adverse external influences, the transformation plan remains on track.

We want to help both our customers and our team members (People), we want to help improve our supply chain by reducing food waste, lowering plastic usage and sourcing ethically (Products). We want to improve energy efficiency, recognising growing concerns over climate change (Planet) and we wish to strengthen partnerships with like-minded organisations who also wish to make a sustainable difference.",18,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"With demand increasing significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we needed to quickly bring additional help onboard to better serve our customers. Based on these needs, we saw an opportunity in Singapore to support other affected industries by offering recruitment opportunities to their teams. We first started the initiative with Fairmont Singapore, then the Food Drinks Allied Workers’ Union (FDAWU) came onboard in support of our efforts and expanded the outreach to more hotel partners, such as the Four Seasons and other international hotel chains. Through this initiative, we provided support to those in the tourism and hospitality industry who have been impacted by COVID-19. We also donated care packs to those in need within our communities.",18,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Part of our ‘Products’ focus is paying attention to animal welfare and we have been working closely with Humane Society International (HSI) to make a change. Together with HSI, we are working to drive long-term change in the supply chain. As part of this, we will be launching a new value range of cage-free eggs under our Meadows Brand in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2021, whilst introducing cage-free eggs into all ten of our IKEA restaurants in 2021 in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our IKEA meatballs are enjoyed around the world, and we listened to our customers to provide them with a more sustainable version of a well-loved classic. Launched in October 2020, the IKEA ‘Plant Balls’ still deliver the great taste and texture of the IKEA meatballs whilst being responsible for just 4% of its predecessors climate footprint. In this way, we are proud to continue innovating in this field and giving our customers the choice to make more environmentally friendly decisions. We do not just focus on life on land. We look to source seafood sustainably, making a concerted effort to protect threatened species and promote products which are MSC, ASC and BAP certified.

"Meat-free IKEA ‘Plant Balls’ – a more sustainable choice. we provide that constantly. Our ‘Fresher for Customers’ programme improves the shopping experience for our customers by managing inventory better to improve freshness and at the same time minimise waste. Through this programme, we have reduced food waste by nearly 10,000 tonnes in the last two years across our markets.",19,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Donating food offers a further opportunity to minimise food waste in our stores, whilst having a positive effect on the welfare of those in need within our communities. For example in Malaysia, Giant collaborated with The Lost Food Project to ensure food is not wasted but delivered to those who need it most. In total, the partnership saw RM50,000 worth of food supplies donated through 26 charity organisations across Klang Valley and Negeri Sembilan. PT Hero partnered with Taman Safari Indonesia to donate fresh produce to animals in conservation. With COVID-19 putting an intense strain on business for zoos and aquariums, this partnership demonstrates a forward-thinking scheme to meet two distinct needs with one fantastic solution. In Singapore, the installation of a food waste management machine, known as an ecoDigester, enables the conversion of organic waste into water for washing. In Hong Kong, our collaboration with O · Park allows us to divert organic waste for conversion into biogas and compost. Moreover, Giant are currently trialling a new composting method with our NGO partner in Indonesia, where larvae decompose food waste into organic fertiliser. We endeavour to roll out similar sustainable technologies in other markets and work towards developing a circular economy within our operations. 17",19,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Accounting policies The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous year. The Directors continue to review the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Group, regarding developments in International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). In 2020, the Group has early adopted the COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions: Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The Amendment allows rent concessions, which are granted as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, to be recognised in the profit and loss over the period to which they relate, subject to satisfying specific conditions, rather than as a modification of the lease following IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. Adoption of the Amendment results in the recognition of US$69 million of rent concessions in other operating income.",48,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"The Group maintained solid cash flows from operating activities after lease payments of US$361 million in the year, compared with US$498 million in 2019. The unfavourable movement in working capital in the year was due principally to investments to maintain availability during the early part of the pandemic, inventory stockpiling as a result of government policies in Singapore, settlement of supplier purchase obligations with respect to an earlier 2020 Chinese New Year as well as lower sales churn in the Health and Beauty business. Normal capital expenditure was lower at US$248 million versus US$305 million in 2019 due principally to tighter control on new store expansions and refurbishment of the existing store estate. The tax payment was higher at US$110 million versus US$25 million in 2019 due to a delay in the timing of the 2019 Hong Kong tax payment to 2020.",50,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Included in this total are 1,371 Yonghui stores, 1,741 Maxim’s stores and 1,853 Robinsons Retail stores. Balance sheet Total assets, excluding cash and bank balances, of US$7.6 billion were broadly in line with 2019. Inventory was down by 13% to US$779 million, reflecting the continuous effort to manage inventory and clear poor-quality stocks.

"The Group ended the year with net debt of US$817 million, broadly in line with last year’s level. Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of US¢11.50 per share, giving a total dividend of US¢16.50 per share for the year, a 21% reduction compared with 2019. Financing The Group, excluding associates and joint ventures, had gross debt of US$1,094 million at 31st December 2020, a drop of US$28 million from 2019. The gross debt is funded by total committed and uncommitted lines of US$3,091 million. At the end of 2020, US$1,319 million of committed and US$676 million of uncommitted facilities were unused and available. The Group had cash balances of US$278 million at 31st December 2020. The Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirements daily. The available undrawn committed facilities and the cash pooling scheme provide good support and flexibility to the Group for the cash in need for the operation. The Directors believe that the Group has strong liquidity to run the business during the pandemic and beyond.",51,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Where required, and typically for working capital purposes, borrowings are normally taken out in local currencies by the Group’s operating subsidiaries to fund daily operations. Borrowings to fund any strategic expansion of the Group are managed centrally and typically funded in United States dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk as may be appropriate depending on the investment. Financial risk management A comprehensive discussion of the Group’s financial risk management policies is included in note 38 to the financial statements. The Group manages its exposure to financial risk using a variety of techniques and instruments. The main objectives are to limit exchange and interest rate risks and to provide a degree of certainty about costs. It is our policy not to engage in speculative derivative transactions. The investment of the Group’s cash resources is managed to minimise risk while seeking to enhance yield. Overall, the Group’s funding arrangements are designed to keep an appropriate balance between equity and debt (short and long-term), to maximise flexibility for the future development of the business. Principal risks and uncertainties A review of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is set out on pages 149 to 150.",51,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Notes to the Financial Statements,62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), including International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) and Interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board. Having considered the impact arising from COVID-19 pandemic and the current economic environment on the Group’s performance and cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group has strong liquidity to run the business during the pandemic and beyond and accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the accounting policies.",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Details of the Group’s principal accounting policies are included in note 36.,62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group has elected to early adopt the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 1: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7’ (effective 1st January 2020) in relation to hedge accounting for the Group’s annual reporting period commencing 1st January 2019.",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The Group has adopted the following changes in relation to rent concessions for the annual reporting period commencing 1st January 2020.,62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions: Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases The Group has early adopted the Amendment, which is effective 1st June 2020. Where the Group is a lessee, the practical expedient is applied to account for the change in lease payments resulting from rent concessions granted as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and elects not to assess these concessions as lease modifications when all of the following conditions are met:",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"(i) the revised lease payments are substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change; (ii) reduction in lease payments relates to payment due on or before 30th June 2021; and (iii) there is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease.",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Rent concessions fulfilling the above conditions are recognised in the profit and loss over the period in which they cover.,62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Apart from the above, there are no other amendments which are effective in 2020 and relevant to the Group’s operations, that have a significant impact on the Group’s results, financial position and accounting policies.",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but not yet effective (note 37).",62,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

9. Intangible Assets continued,71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (‘CGU’) identified by banners or group of stores acquired in each territory. The table below analyses the carrying value of goodwill by groups of CGU.,71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Management has assessed the recoverable amount of each CGU based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on approved budgets and projections based on the weighted average of remaining lease terms ranging from five to 15 years.,71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Following the impairment review, goodwill relating to PT Hero amounted US$38.6 million was fully impaired and charged to the profit and loss during the year. In 2019, goodwill arising from the acquisition of the remaining 70% shareholding in Jutaria amounted to US$4.4 million (note 29(d)) was fully impaired after the impairment review.",71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"During the year, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Rose Pharmacy to a subsidiary of Robinsons Retail (note 29(f)).",71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations for the significant balances of goodwill in 2020 include budgeted gross margins between 22% and 26% (2019: 18% and 31%) and average sales growth rates are between 1.0% and 5.0% (2019: 1.0% and 2.7%) to project cash flows, which vary across the Group’s business segments and geographical locations, over the weighted average of remaining lease terms, and are based on management expectations for the market development; and pre-tax discount rates of between 5% and 12% (2019: 5% and 14%) applied to the cash flow projections. The discount rates used reflect business specific risks relating to the relevant industry, business life-cycle and geographical location. On the basis of this review, management concluded that no further impairment charge is required.",71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Other intangible assets comprise mainly trademarks.,71,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

15. Deferred Tax Assets/(Liabilities) continued,82,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
Deferred tax balances predominantly comprise non-current items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted when the taxes relate to the same taxation authority and where offsetting is allowed.,82,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Deferred tax assets of US$75.7 million (2019: US$46.3 million) arising from unused tax losses of US$328.2 million (2019: US$192.1 million) have not been recognised in the financial statements. Included in the unused tax losses, US$22.1 million have no expiry date and the balance will expire at various dates up to and including 2030.",82,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"At 31st December 2020, no deferred tax liabilities arising on temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries had been recognised as there were no undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries. At 31st December 2019, deferred tax liabilities of US$1.8 million arising on temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries of US$18.4 million had not been recognised as there was no intention of remitting the retained earnings of these subsidiaries to the holding companies in the foreseeable future.",82,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The weighted average interest rate on deposits with banks at 31st December 2020 was 0.4% (2019: 2.2%) per annum.,82,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines, with the major plan in Hong Kong. These plans are final salary defined benefits, calculated based on members’ lengths of service and their salaries in the final years leading up to retirement. All pension benefits are paid in one lump sum. With the exception of certain plans, all the defined benefit plans are closed to new members. In addition, all plans are impacted by discount rate while liabilities are driven by salary growth.",88,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group’s defined benefit plans are both funded and unfunded, with the assets of the funded plans held independently of the Group’s assets in separate trustee administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices in each country. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the boards of trustees. The Group’s major plans are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.",88,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"“ 2020 was a challenging year for Dairy Farm, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the Group’s operations and, as a result, its financial results. Continued progress in implementing the Group’s transformation programme, however, helped the business adapt to the rapidly changing environment, while the diversity of the Group’s businesses, coupled with the impact of ongoing efficiency improvement programmes, supported the Group’s overall financial performance.”",8,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Overview 2020 was a challenging year for Dairy Farm, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the Group’s operations and, as a result, its financial results. Continued progress in implementing the Group’s transformation programme, however, helped the business adapt to the rapidly changing environment, while the diversity of the Group’s businesses, coupled with the impact of ongoing efficiency improvement programmes, supported the Group’s overall financial performance. A number of key initiatives gathered momentum in the year and the Group is now more effectively leveraging scale and developing an improved customer proposition across all banners and markets.",8,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Operating performance Sales of US$10.3 billion for the year by the Group’s subsidiaries were 8% behind those of 2019. Total sales, including 100% of associates and joint ventures, were 2% higher at US$28.2 billion, primarily due to a higher sales contribution from Yonghui.",8,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The Group’s subsidiaries saw underlying operating profit of US$412 million, 6% behind the previous year. Strong growth in operating profit for Grocery Retail and IKEA was offset by a reduction in profit for the Health and Beauty and Convenience businesses. Among the Group’s subsidiaries, disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact on our Health and Beauty business in Hong Kong.",8,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Underlying profit attributable to shareholders was US$276 million, down 14% from US$321 million last year. Underlying earnings per share of US¢20.38 were also down 14%.",8,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31st December 2020 was 7.1 years (2019: 7.6 years).,90,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is as follows:,90,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligations calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liabilities recognised within the balance sheet.",90,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"Share-based long-term incentive plans (‘LTIP’) have been put in place to provide incentives for selected executives. Awards take the form of share options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company with exercise prices based on the then prevailing market prices, however, share awards which will vest free of payment may also be made. Awards normally vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant and may be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.",92,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"An LTIP was adopted by the Company on 5th March 2015. Under these awards, free shares are received by the participants to the extent the award vests. Conditions, if any, are at the discretion of the Directors. There were no share awards granted in 2020 and 2019.",92,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"Prior to the adoption of the LTIP, The Dairy Farm International Share Option Plan 2005 provided selected executives with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. The exercise prices of the granted options were, in general, based on the average market prices for the five trading days immediately preceding the dates of grant of the options. Options are normally vested over a period of up to three years and are exercisable for up to ten years following the date of grant.",92,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The fair value of options granted during the year, determined using the trinomial valuation model, was US$0.1 million. The significant inputs into the model, based on the number of options issued, were share price of US$4.46 at the grant date, exercise price of US$5.93, expected volatility based on the last five years of 24.21%, dividend yield of 4.33%, option life of six years, and annual risk-free interest rate of 0.35%. Options are assumed to be exercised at the end of the fifth year following the date of grant. No options were granted in 2019.",92,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

"A new LTIP 2018-2022 was adopted by the Company on 5th December 2018. The cash-settled scheme has been designed to align management’s reward with shareholders’ interests, over a five-year period, while also considering how management delivers earnings growth. This scheme is aimed at investing in new people capabilities as well as retaining high potential individuals for stronger succession planning. The scheme has been designed to appropriately compensate, attract and retain experienced senior management.",94,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf
"The scheme will be predominantly measured based on compound growth in underlying earnings per share. To ensure that the growth is delivered appropriately, another measure based on health of business (focused on areas such as quality of earnings and balance sheet strength) is also incorporated. Finally, a sustainability check will be applied after the end of the five-year period to ensure that the results are sustainable.",94,dairy-farm_ar2020pdf

Governments also generate revenue through indirect taxes on products and services, often asconsumption taxespaid by consumers but in some cases also by businesses. These includenon-recoverable VAT, customs, excise and other duties.",10,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"When a business collects indirect taxes on behalf of a government, it carries the cost of gathering the financial data, preparing reports and executing payments. This process helps governments collect taxes more efficiently because it is easier to collect VAT from businesses than from individual consumers.",10,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
OECD data on the average split of member countries’ tax revenues show that corporate income tax raises around 10% of total tax revenues.,10,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"Shell companies in Germany are subject to a corporate income tax rate of 32%. In the period 2009-2016, Shell made no profits in Germany, resulting in a loss carry-forward position which has been used to partly offset taxable profits in 2017-2018. Shell also made a loss in 2019 and 2020. This was due to a number of reasons, including a surplus of fuel supply in Europe and a significant drop in demand and prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. German tax law allows Shell to offset 60% of its yearly tax profits with a loss carry-forward and to pay a minimum tax on the remaining 40%. Shell in Germany continues with an overall loss carry-forward position.",121,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

The corporate income tax rate in the UK is 40% for upstream UK continental shelf activities and 19% for all other activities.,137,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
Shell did not pay corporate income tax in 2020 because of tax losses arising in the current and previous years. These losses are due to significant upstream investment in the UK continental shelf. Shell also received tax refunds related to decommissioning costs incurred.

"Decommissioning is a cost incurred as part of the life cycle of the field and is tax deductible.

"The UAE taxes revenues from certain activities, including those from petroleum operations which are subject to corporate income tax at 55%. Additional taxes, such as royalties or gas tax, may also be due and are based on individual agreements with the government. The tax paid by Shell in the UAE mainly relates to upstream activities. Revenues are taxed in line with the agreement with the government. In 2020, a greater proportion of revenues arose from downstream activities that are not subject to income tax.",145,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report “Shell”, “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words “we”, “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’, “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this report refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”, respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Shell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, Shell’s operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions do not reflect our net-zero emissions target. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement.",156,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"In 2020, Shell filed around 5,900 direct tax returns and around 36,700 indirect tax returns. We filed these on time in almost 100% of cases. We also processed more than 24,200 separate tax payments. A small number of returns may be submitted late. When this is the case, we carefully monitor the reasons, learn from them and pay any applicable late-filing fees.

"DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY Our aim is to take sustainable tax positions in support of our business investments, which may be of a long-term nature. When we apply tax legislation, we do so with the reasonable expectation that our interpretation will be upheld in court. Sometimes, the law or how to apply it is unclear to taxpayers. In these situations, we may seek to find clarity by talking to thetax authority as part of a co-operative compliance arrangement.",23,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"A co-operative compliance arrangement means we engage with tax authorities, providing them with real-time information before filing a tax return. We have co-operative compliance arrangements with the tax authorities in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore and the UK. We are exploring possibilities for establishing moreco-operative compliancerelationships in other countries. In 2020, we continued our discussions with senior tax officials in Kazakhstan about a pilot co-operative compliance scheme.",23,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"Tax authorities in different countries can hold conflicting views about how the taxation of multinational enterprises should be interpreted or applied. When this lack of clarity occurs within a tax treaty or agreement between countries, we may use a mutual agreement procedure where the authorities aim to resolve the issue between themselves.",23,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"If we are still unable to reach an agreement with an authority, we may have to test the legal principle of the tax law concerned through the judicial system. However, we take this approach only when other options have not provided a resolution. For example, in 2016, we challenged a value-added levy on oil extraction imposed by Brazil’s State of Rio de Janeiro because we believed the obligations arising from the law were not legally sustainable. In March 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the levy was unconstitutional.",23,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"We are improving our data management to meet compliance and transparency requirements more efficiently. In 2020, we continued to enhance our “one click tax returns” tool in the USA, which analyses transactions subject to excise tax on a real-time basis for accuracy and completeness.

"For example, it is common practice in many countries for tax authorities to issue preliminary corporate income tax assessments during the fiscal year, requiring companies to make prepayments. Where possible, we have worked with tax authorities to revise prepaymentestimates for 2020 to account for the economic downturn and the latest estimates of tax due. This cooperation enabled us to pay the right amount of taxes.",26,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

CASE STUDY,27,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"NORWAY FISCAL RESPONSE TO LOW ENERGY PRICES In 2020, Norway introduced temporarytax incentivesfor the petroleum industry as a response to declining energy prices and economic uncertainty, both of which may have reduced planned oil and gas investment. The measures were designed to secure jobs in the oil and gas industry and related services sector. We made use of these government incentives in 2020.",27,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In Norway, Shell is subject to an upstream tax rate of 78%. This comprises the statutory corporate income tax of 22% and a special upstream tax rate of 56%. The temporary tax measures include allowing oil and gas companies to deduct the cost of investments made in 2020 and 2021 against the special upstream tax in the year the costs are incurred. Previously, deductions would have been taken over six years.",27,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In Norway, there is also an additional 20.8% deduction of investment costs (known as an uplift) taken over four years at the 56% special tax rate. The new measures now allow companies to immediately claim 24% deduction in the year the investment cost occurred for the years 2020 and 2021.",27,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
The temporary measures will also be available for new projects that have delivered a development plan by the end of 2022 which has been approved by the Ministry of Oil and Energy by the end of 2023.

TAX INCENTIVES,28,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We continue to review our approach to tax incentives, because we believe that greater transparency promotes a better understanding of what tax incentives are designed to achieve. There is no common definition of a tax incentive. Shell defines tax incentives as fiscal measures designed by governments to stimulate investment and encourage growth, or a change of behaviour, by providing more favourable tax treatment to certain activities or sectors. In 2020, we decided to use this definition to assess whether a measure offered by a government is a tax incentive. We seek to ensure that tax incentives are transparent and consistent with statutory and regulatory frameworks before deciding whether to make use of them. We only make use of incentives where they are aligned with our business and operational objectives and where we have a qualifying business activity.",28,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"When we accept tax incentives offered by governments to support investment, employment and economic development, we seek to implement them in the manner intended by the relevant statutory, regulatory or administrative framework. If there is uncertainty, we will seek to engage with the relevant authorities to agree implementation aligned with the intended policy objectives.",28,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"The tax rules in most countries were written before the development of renewable energy technologies. Redesigning tax rules to include incentives that encourage the supply of and demand for renewable energy will play an important part in advancing the energy transition. These measures could help make zero-carbon energy more affordable so that it can compete favourably with fossil fuels. For example, some governments offer incentives for investments that will help to reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise, like shipping, aviation and road freight.",29,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Many of the technologies for renewable power generation are in their infancy and require considerable upfront investment in infrastructure. Incentives encourage this investment and may include tax credits for solar projects or allowing accelerated depreciation for offshore wind turbines.

LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS,35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Low-tax jurisdictions, so-called tax havens, are typically considered to mean countries with significantly lower effective tax rates compared with the average rates offered by other countries. In some cases, the corporate income tax rate is zero. Governments have a sovereign right to determine tax matters in their countries and sometimes set low corporate income tax rates to attract investment from outside their borders. In recent years, international organisations, such as the OECD, and many countries have discussed whether a country’s low-tax policy may have a negative impact on other countries. They have also debated various ways of addressing this. Most recently and steered by the G20, the OECD has been developing proposals for a coordinated two-pillar response. Shell supports such an internationally coordinated approach which avoids problems caused by unilateral actions that can lead to the fragmentation of tax rules. Pillar One aims to align taxes more closely with local market engagement so that a larger portion of profits is taxed in the jurisdiction where sales are made, even if a multinational does not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction of sale. Pillar Two introduces new rules to ensure a minimum level of effective taxation for all profits made by multinationals.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell has a taxable presence in 99 countries and locations, with different tax regimes and varying corporate income tax rates. When we are present in low-tax jurisdictions, we are there for commercial reasons, such as crude oil trading and retail sites. These reasons can also include the presence of companies that hold investments or perform other services we need such as pensions, finance and insurance. In line with the Shell Responsible Tax Principles, we do not use these locations to avoid tax on activities that take place elsewhere.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"When we invest in a country, we consider factors which include access to local or regional markets, the stability of the political, regulatory and social environment, local infrastructure and workforce. We also consider the overall costs of operation and the attractiveness and stability of a country’s fiscal regime. However, the investment must first meet our strategic, business or operational aims.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
REVIEWING ENTITIES IN LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS We conducted a review in 2019 and 2020 of Shell-controlled and Shell-operated entities incorporated or present inlow-tax jurisdictionsagainst our Shell Responsible Tax Principles. The review considered the purpose of the entity and whether it should continue to be in that jurisdiction.,35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We identified entities that are no longer active and can be liquidated as a matter of good corporate governance. We also identified entities that can be restructured and held or operated from another jurisdiction. In other cases, our review concluded that the entities could remain in low- or zero-tax jurisdictions because there was a commercial reason for being there.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"As part of the review, in 2020 we liquidated four legal entities in Bermuda and relocated another two Bermuda entities to the Netherlands. We also reviewed recently acquired entities, such as holding companies in Saint Lucia for upstream and LNG operations in the Caribbean. Following this review, we consolidated the operations and simplified the holding structures. As a result, we identified four Saint Lucian entities for liquidation and completed these liquidations in 2021.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In 2020, we also piloted a new assurance control process to transform this review into an annual exercise undertaken by the countrytax manager in each low-tax jurisdiction. This will now form part of the tax control framework from 2021 onwards and will provide ongoing assurance that Group structures in low-tax jurisdictions continue to be there for commercial reasons. The new assurance control process will also identify potential liquidations and restructuring.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"For example, at the time of our 2020 review, Oman was on the European Union (EU) list of non-co-operative jurisdictions, which is sometimes referred to as the EUtax havenblacklist. Our review concluded that the Shell entities in that country have substantial operational activities, including exploration, production, trading and retail. We therefore considered our presence in Oman to be forcommercial reasonsand appropriate.",35,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"SUPPORTING INCENTIVES FOR ADVANCED BIOFUELS Biofuels are a renewable energy source, made from organic matter or waste, which can significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from transport. Biofuels are blended with other fuels such as gasoline and diesel. They can help decarbonise the aviation, marine and heavy-duty road transport sectors. Governments can use instruments like tax incentives to encourage investment in the development and production of biofuels.",39,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops, such as corn, sugar cane or vegetable oil. However, there is an opportunity to increase low-carbon biofuels production without increasing land use. With this purpose, we are focusing on using new technologies to produce advanced fuels from alternative feedstocks – such as forestry products and agricultural waste (otherwise known as cellulosic materials, meaning they come from the fibrous walls of a plant structure).",39,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

INDIRECT TAX ADVOCACY,41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Around the world there are increasingly frequent and often complex changes to laws governing indirect taxes, such as VAT, excise duties, and environmental taxes. Many of these developments are linked to the energy transition and to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.",41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"For example, the growing electric vehicle market requires governments to consider the most appropriate mechanisms to ensure the fair and sustainable taxation of the sale and use of electric vehicles.",41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Within the EU, one key element of debate is how to consistently apply VAT to electric vehicle charging services across all 27 member states, while also enabling them to meet their pledge to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Shell has been an active participant in discussions with the European Commission to agree a harmonised approach to electric vehicle charging that is consistent with the treatment of electricity supply in other contexts.",41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Similarly, both the VAT and excise duty treatment of aviation and marine fuels are under review by the EU. As with theVAT treatment of electric vehicle charging, Shell supports indirect tax policies that promote lower- and zero-carbon transport solutions as long as any tax treatment is consistently applied throughout the EU.",41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell supports measures that combat criminal activity. As a global business, we contribute our experience and insight to discussions aimed at strengthening processes and controls. Together with other companies, we also call for a simplified and harmonised regulation process in support of fair and efficient indirect tax systems.",41,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

CASE STUDY,46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"TAX TREATMENT OF DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas structure. Safe and responsible decommissioning is a priority for Shell when a facility reaches the end of its life. This includes restoring the surroundings of offshore platforms and facilities in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
The decommissioning phase of work is heavily regulated and subject to tax legislation that enables tax relief. The concept of granting tax relief for genuine business expenses is fundamental to regimes that tax profits and is applicable and available to all businesses in all industries with few exceptions. Decommissioning costs in the oil and gas industry are treated consistently as a business expense.,46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"At the end of 2020, Shell reported$27.3 billionon its balance sheet for non-current decommissioning and other provisions (see ourAnnual Report and Accounts).",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Corporate income tax is paid on profits, which for an oil or gas field are calculated as the sum of the income generated by the facility, minus the costs of setting it up, operating it and decommissioning the field at the end of its life.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Decommissioning costs are treated differently depending on a country’s tax regime. For example, in the UK costs can only be deducted once decommissioning starts, whereas in other countries these costs can be deducted annually before the asset is decommissioned. Here we present examples of how tax relief for decommissioning costs is obtained in two different countries:",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"DECOMMISSIONING IN THE UK Our largest decommissioning project is theBrent oil and gas field, which lies in the North Sea between the UK and Norway. Preparation for decommissioning the four Brent platforms – Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta – started in 2006. We decommissioned Brent Delta in 2017 and Brent Bravo in 2019. In 2020, the Brent Alpha topside, the part of the platform that is visible above the sea, and the upper jacket, which supports the topside, were removed and sent for dismantling and recycling onshore.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The UK tax regime prescribes that a deduction for decommissioning costs is available only when the cash associated with decommissioning costs has actually been spent. If large sums of cash are spent on decommissioning in a year when insufficient income is generated by the business, this can result in a tax loss for that year. When this occurs, that loss is used to offset historical tax that has been paid in prior years and this results in a tax refund.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The taxable profits over the field’s lifetime will be the same as if the decommissioning deductions had been taken earlier, before decommissioning. The refunds do not represent any additional subsidy or contribution towards this cost.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The UK government has received more than£20 billion [A]in tax revenues (in today’s money) from the Brent oil and gas field since it started producing in 1976. In 2020, Shell received a£67.5 million[B] refund in respect of its Brent decommissioning activities. Decommissioning is due to be completed in 2024. Once complete, the total tax refunds Shell will have received are expected to be significantly less than the tax payments made.",46,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

DECOMMISSIONING IN KAZAKHSTAN Kazakhstan requires companies operating under active concession or production-sharing agreements that have been signed since 1997 to set up a decommissioning fund. Each individual contract specifies when the fund should be established. Companies are required to make regular contributions to the fund to cover any future decommissioning costs. Contribution amounts are specified in the concession contract or production-sharing agreement. This system allows for companies to spread decommissioning costs over the lifetime of a project.,47,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Once companies have paid these contributions into an escrow account, they can tax-deduct them rather than wait years for the actual decommissioning costs to be deductible at the end of a project’s lifetime.",47,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"If actual decommissioning costs exceed what is available in the fund, then the rules allow for excess costs to be tax deductible in the year the cash is spent. If the fund accumulates more cash than is spent on decommissioning, then the excess cash is subject to corporate income tax as income at the end of the life of the field. Shell’s existing production-sharing agreements in Kazakhstan have similar provisions to the decommissioning fund.",47,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

TAXATION OF LNG WITH OFFSETS We are working with our customers to reduce the emissions created when they use our energy products. New types of products and supply chains will be established to meet the growing demand for low-emission products. We expect this to change the amount and types of taxes we pay in some countries.,49,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"For example, we provide liquefied natural gas (LNG) with offsets [A] which uses nature-based carbon credits to offset the full life-cycle emissions associated with the production and use of LNG. Credits are sourced from Shell’s global portfolio of nature- based carbon offset projects. Our cargoes of LNG with offsets span many tax jurisdictions, from the countries where we source our LNG and carbon offsets to the countries where our customers are located. The taxation of LNG with offsets is complex because of the different tax rules in different locations.",49,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The revenue from the sale of a cargo of LNG with offsets is assessed for tax when the title passes to the customer. Direct and indirect taxation may vary in some jurisdictions, depending on whether the LNG and the carbon credits are bundled or sold separately.",49,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"There may be differences in the indirect tax treatment of LNG and carbon credits, depending on the jurisdiction of the seller. In addition, there may be different customs and indirect tax treatments in the customer’s import jurisdiction.",49,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"Our tax data reflect the varied nature of our activities. We have a large portfolio of assets and businesses in different countries and at different stages of the business cycle, from start-up to decommissioning. The business model, the stage in the investment cycle and business performance drive much of our taxes paid.",52,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Our business profits are closely linked to oil and gas prices and so are our taxes. When oil prices are higher, we see a greater proportion of profits being taxed at higher upstream tax rates. When oil prices are lower, a lower overall effective tax rate (ETR) might be expected. While average oil and gas industry prices in 2020 were lower than in 2019, Shell’s ETR in 2020 was primarily influenced by asset impairments. Further details on our ETR can be found in theAnnual Report and Accounts 2020.",52,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
The Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses generate a significant part of our taxation charge. Governments often have specific oil and gas fiscal regimes with tax rates that are higher than those for other industries.

"In addition to corporate income taxes, we pay import and export duties and other tariffs on our transport and trading activities.

ALLOCATION OF COSTS,56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell’s centralised services and business service centres charge fees for services that provide a benefit for the receiving entities and which these entities would have been willing to pay a third party to provide. Shell’s operating companies using centralised services pay a fee, which is based on the actual cost of providing the services.",56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
The costs of these services are incurred in direct support of Group business activities and need to be fairly charged to the entities benefiting from the services. All Group entities should bear their fair share of the costs. Costs are not excessively charged to entities in higher-tax jurisdictions where they could be deducted and used to manipulate taxable profit to a lower level.,56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In cases where there is just one recipient of a service, the entity pays a direct fee for the service it has received based on the actual cost of the service. However, if there are different entities receiving the same service, they share the cost. Their share is allocated proportionately based on an appropriate measure of the usage of the service, for example capital and operating expenditure, staff employed or orders processed.",56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell’s service cost allocation system, including the proportionate allocation of costs, is set up and operated in accordance with the guidance provided by the OECD.",56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
BUSINESS SERVICE CENTRES Our businesses are supported by business service centres around the world. The choice of location for these centres is based on available expertise and costs which compare favourably with alternative outsourcing solutions.,56,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"Daily treasury operations include management of foreign exchange for the different currencies that are needed by Shell around the world. Treasury also advises on the financing of Group subsidiaries and joint ventures and manages the Group’s surplus funds and external bank accounts. It is also responsible for issuing external and internal guarantees to ensure contractual and regulatory obligations are met and that Shell’s licence to operate is maintained. Oil, gas and renewables projects, which can take years to develop, need significant capital. Our operating companies require a balance between equity and long-term loan funding. We have capitalised Group lending entities in the Netherlands, the UK and Singapore to provide the loan financing. We ended our Swiss and Bermudan lending activities in 2019 and mid-2020 respectively, after reviewing their presence in theselow-tax jurisdictions.",57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Treasury reviews the funding needs of Shell’s operating companies around the world on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is an appropriate mix of equity and debt. Treasury manages deposits from operating companies that generate cash. This cash, the returns from operating companies plus external debt, is used to provide long-term funding including loans with interest due and paid as if these loans had been sourced from external financial markets or institutions.",57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

INSURANCE,57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The oil and gas industry can face severe, low-frequency risks. Globally, there are few insurers who can insure appropriately against some of these risks. Shell – like other major oil and gas companies – self-insures most of its risk exposure.",57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell’s principal insurance company, Solen Versicherungen AG (Solen), is based in Switzerland where we have qualified insurance specialists to manage our insurance activities. This includes underwriting, risk management, claims handling and balance sheet management. Solen does not outsource any of its critical business functions.",57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Solen offers a range of insurance products and services to Shell operating companies and joint venture companies, including those that are not controlled by Shell.

"Solen has a licence to conduct insurance business from the Swiss insurance regulator (the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA). FINMA’s regulatory requirements for Solen are the same as for independent insurance companies.",57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
Solen maintains the required level of capitalisation to comply with Swiss regulatory and rating agency requirements. Solen’s capital is maintained at a level that ensures an ‘A’ rating from global credit rating agency AM Best. This is higher than the Swiss solvency requirements and allows Solen to enter into commercial arrangements with third-party insurance suppliers and joint- venture customers.,57,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"CASE STUDY CENTRALISED SERVICES IN SWITZERLAND Shell has centralised insurance, trademark management and some currency hedging services in Switzerland. We have around 300 branded retail sites in the country, which serve around 80,000 customers every day, and a lubricants blending plant. We employ around 120 people in Switzerland. Switzerland had a low-tax regime that was the subject of public scrutiny. On January 1, 2020, Switzerland implemented tax reforms to replace certain preferential tax regimes with internationally accepted measures. The new measures have resulted in a combined regional and federal tax rate of 12% from 2020. Here we provide more information about Shell’s activities in Switzerland and the essential role they play in supporting our business activities. INSURANCE The Shell Group is exposed to material risks which are predominantly insured by Solen Versicherungen AG, a Shell entity in Switzerland. We maintain capital and reserves in the event of a claim and we employ professionals with finance and specialist insurance knowledge, including in-house actuarial expertise. Shell’s insurance operation is licensed and regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). TRADEMARK MANAGEMENT Shell has a number of trademarks used by both Shell companies and third parties including those that own and operate some of our retail sites. Most Shell trademarks are owned by Shell Brands International AG (SBI), which is based in Switzerland.",58,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"SBI owns, licenses, enhances and protects the value of Shell trademarks. SBI receives royalty payments from Shell operating companies and third-party licensees. The royalty payments are determined using the same methodology. Revenues from third- party licensees account for more than 50% of the total trademark royalty revenues.",58,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"CURRENCY HEDGING SERVICES Shell, like any other multinational company, is exposed to movements in the value of different currencies as part of normal business operations.

MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Jessica Uhl, Chief Financial Officer",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Early in 2021, we set out our Powering Progress strategy, which has four main goals: generating value for our shareholders, achieving net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives and livelihoods. We have set ambitious targets against each of these goals as we work to play a leading role in the energy transition while making a positive contribution to society.",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In November, we took a further step to simplify Royal Dutch Shell plc and strengthen our competitiveness. We announced plans to establish a single line of shares, and to align the tax residence of Royal Dutch Shell plc with itscountryof incorporation in the UK. This proposal, which has been approved by our shareholders, will allow us to manage our portfolio with greater agility and to accelerate distributions to shareholders, among other benefits.",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We believe these changes will support the delivery of our strategy, including our focus on being a responsible provider of energy products, while demonstrating our values and principles. These values and principles are reflected in our commitment to safety, to respecting human rights and to paying the right amount of taxes so that we make a meaningful financial contribution to the countries where we operate.",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"As countries seek to rebuild economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the payment of taxes by companies is more important than ever. We support the co-ordinated effort to make the global tax system fairer and the agreement to establish a global minimum corporate tax reached by the G20 leaders, together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"TRANSPARENCY IN CHALLENGING TIMES One of the ways we can show we are responsible contributors to society is to be transparent about what we do.

Each year, we look to expand and improve our report and I hope you find value in these changes.",5,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"In this report, we disclose ourcountry-by-country report(CbCR) data for 99 countries and locations in which we have ataxable presenceand where we report financial figures. Where CbCR report data are not available for this report, we have provided information from our Payments to Governments Report [A]. Our Payments to Governments Report also discloses other forms of payments. These include production entitlements, royalties, fees and bonus payments. Where made, these payments have been referenced under each applicable country.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We share more information about our presence and purpose in each country and location, as well as relevant financial data which help determine Shell’s overall tax and economic contribution.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
The OECD developed and implemented CbCR in 2017 and all large multinational enterprises are required to file reports with tax authorities.,60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The nature of our business varies and we can have more than one kind of activity wherever we are present. Under OECD rules, CbCR is prepared using aggregated financial data. It is therefore not always possible to draw conclusions about a single entity, business or venture.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
This report shows aggregated country data for entities that are consolidated or proportionally consolidated in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020. We also include data for the Shell share of non-consolidated joint ventures and associates. These data are reported in the country where the entity holding the shares is based.,60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Shell uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) data and US dollars as the reporting currency in its CbCR. The main data source is the consolidated Group reporting system, but reliance is also placed on data from local accounting systems for specific items.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"The financial information taken from our consolidated Group reporting system has been prepared under Shell’s general financial controls. CbCR reports are not subject to an external audit, statement or opinion.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
CBCR DEFINITIONS The OECD requires certain data to be included in CbCR. See below for definitions of the key country-by-country reporting terms.,60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"REVENUES Revenues are disclosed as a split between those from related parties and those from third parties. For CbCR, third parties would include non-consolidated joint ventures and associates for the purposes of our Annual Report and Accounts 2020.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Third-party revenues include sales of products, interest income,dividendincome and other income. Related-party revenues include transactions between consolidated Group entities. For example, related-party revenues arise if our Trading organisation buys oil or gas from our Upstream organisation and sells it to our Downstream organisation.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Within one country or location, many of these related party transactions may occur, as Shell entities buy and sell goods, or provide and receive services, to or from each other. Shell includes all these transactions in its aggregated CbCR data. For example, feedstock could be sold to a refinery, refined and then processed further in a chemical plant before being traded by Shell. This can occur within one country or location. In this case, each of these sales between different entities would be counted as related-party revenues. These can represent large amounts.",60,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
PROFIT BEFORE TAX Profit or loss before tax is reported in Shell’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Any share of profit or loss from non-consolidated joint ventures and associates is reported under the country where the entity holding the shares is based. This is the profit or loss calculated using Group accounting policies. Local statutory accounts may need to comply with local accounting standards which may be different. The local statutory accounting profit or loss is the basis for the calculation of taxable profits in individual countries or locations. Local tax laws are then applied to the profit or loss. Profit before tax shows the Group accounting result but not the profits subject to tax after compliance with local tax laws.

"The tax paid figure relates to Shell’s downstream and onshore upstream activities. Corporate income tax was paid for onshore activities but not for offshore activities because of losses incurred in previous years in the offshore concessions.

"EXPANDING OUR REPORTS Shell continues to be open about the taxes we pay while looking to provide more insight into the role of tax in our businesses. For example, for this report, we have reviewed our reporting oftax incentives, including exemptions and reliefs. Governments around the world use tax incentives to encourage investment, job creation and to support certain industries. They also use them to drive key policies, such as reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.",6,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We believe that more transparency around these incentives will lead to greater understanding of what they are intended to achieve and whether they are meeting their goals. We have expanded our reporting of tax incentives as a result, with many examples in this report.",6,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We have also continued to review our presence in low- and zero-tax jurisdictions, countries with significantly lower tax rates than the average, against our Responsible Tax Principles. This resulted in our ending some activities in Bermuda and St Lucia. And we will keep assessing whether our presence inlow-tax jurisdictionsis appropriate for our business.",6,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"WIDER CONTRIBUTION This report includes a breakdown of our total tax contribution in five countries where we have key business activities: the UK, the USA, the Netherlands, Nigeria and India. This goes beyond corporate income tax to include the taxes we pay as an employer, such as social security payments, and the taxes we collect from our employees on behalf of governments.",6,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"We hope this more detailed look at these five countries provides a clearer picture of our activities and contribution to the countries where we operate. We will extend this approach to other countries if we hear from investors, governments, non- governmental organisations and wider society that it would help them to further understand our contribution.",6,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"Tax systems around the world vary and can be complex. However, the tax systems in places where Shell does business have some basic rules in common.",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"MOST BUSINESSES PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAX WHERE PROFITS ARE MADE Corporate income taxis typically due by law in countries where profits are made. This should correspond to where the business activity occurred. The tax due is determined by the tax system of the country or location where that activity took place. Governments design and apply tax rules to the profits generated in their countries and assess what is owed by businesses. Corporate income tax is payable on profits, not revenues. See the table “Simplified example of application of local tax law” for how tax rules are applied to calculate the tax due.",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Sometimes a multinational enterprise like Shell facesdouble taxation. This is when two countries seek to tax the same business income, resulting in a company being taxed twice. We believe that profit should only be taxed once, in line with the positions of the United Nations and the OECD.",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In 2020, Shell reported a total loss before tax of $27 billion. Shell companies still paid $3.4 billion [A] in corporate income tax as some of our companies reported a profit in 2020 and/or settled taxes from the previous year. Shell paid a further $3.5 billion in royalties to governments. We also reported a corporate income tax credit of $5.4 billion for 2020.",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"In most countries and locations, thecorporate income taxwe pay differs from the accounting tax credit or charge. This is because tax paid can include payments relating to previous years, the current year and future years.",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Oureffective tax rate(ETR) is calculated by dividing the tax credit of $5.4 billion by the total loss before taxation of $27 billion, resulting in an ETR of 20.1% for 2020. For comparison, the average corporate income tax rate levied by the 37 countries that were members of the OECD in 2020 was 23.1% [B].",8,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

"In the past three years, our ETR has been higher than the average corporate income tax rate in OECD countries, partly because many governments apply a higher corporate income tax rate to profits made by oil and gas production activities.

"TAX GENERATES REVENUE FOR GOVERNMENTS Tax revenues enable governments to pay for public services, such as education, health care and transport. Governments set their fiscal policies and the rules for individual and business taxes. Tax treatments — such as tax rates, reliefs, exemptions and allowances or disallowances — are typically approved by national parliaments. Companies must comply with relevant tax laws. Audits and controls by tax authorities help to check whether companies are compliant.",9,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Governments can use targeted tax incentives for specific policy objectives, such as protecting the environment, reducing carbon emissions or encouraging advances in areas like research and development. Governments often design incentives to attract domestic and international investment, which can boost economies, create jobs and develop communities. When available and appropriate, we make use oftax incentivesand exemptions where we have a business activity that qualifies.",9,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf
"Some governments may choose to lower specific taxes, like corporate income tax. These are deliberate policy decisions and not unintended tax loopholes. Such incentives are designed by governments to attract investment in areas where development may benefit their countries. When governments offer such incentives, they may expect to raise revenues through other types of taxes, such asemployment taxesor export duties.",9,shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf

Approach to tax Here we explore how our approach applies to our clients and our businesses.,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Our clients Our tax principles make it very clear that all tax planning for our clients must support genuine commercial activity. While our clients are ultimately responsible for any decisions in relation to their tax affairs, we, like other banks, do provide some tax related products to our clients. These products are well-understood by tax authorities and often deliver tax incentives specifically intended by governments.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Conversely, for example, we would not provide non-standard loan funding to a client, where the funding is integral to the client’s tax planning, if the tax planning does not comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the law.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Our business Tax influences decisions about how we run and organise our business and about where we base our operations. Making these decisions is an integral part of running a global commercial organisation. When tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, the decisions we make are consistent with our tax principles and profits are taxed in the locations in which the economic activity generating them takes place.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Accordingly, transactions that artificially transfer profits into a low tax jurisdiction would not be consistent with this approach or our tax principles. A key part of ensuring we pay taxes in the countries where economic value is created is how we price transactions between our group companies, more commonly known as ‘transfer pricing’.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"When we invest in our business, we may benefit from tax incentives as intended by national governments, some of which are discussed further on page 11.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Approach to tax,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Our approach to transfer pricing in more detail:,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"The prices applied to our intra-group transactions are representative of the prices that would be paid in respect of transactions between independent parties (also known as ‘arm’s-length pricing’). The ‘arm’s-length prices’ that we apply are derived from established and widely accepted international standards such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are applied on a globally consistent basis across all countries in which we operate. We seek to comply with all global and local documentation requirements to support the arm’s length prices applied to our intra-group transactions including, for instance, undertaking external economic benchmarking studies of comparable transactions between third parties. Tax authorities may sometimes take a differing view of what an arm’s-length price should be for a transaction. This can lead to the same income being taxed in two countries (often referred to as ‘double taxation’).",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"National governments often seek to reduce double taxation by entering into double taxation treaties between one another. These treaties include mechanisms for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price for a transaction between one another and the taxpayer. These mechanisms can include ‘Mutual Agreement Procedures’ (MAP) which allow tax authorities in two countries to agree on a mutually acceptable arm’s-length price where the taxpayer has been unable to reach an agreement with the tax authorities directly. Treaties may also include a mechanism for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price on an upfront basis with a taxpayer through ‘Advance Pricing Agreements’ (APA). Where we are or may be subject to double taxation, we do seek to reach agreement on an appropriate arm’s-length price through one of the generally available mechanisms outlined above.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"We have also historically incorporated companies under the laws of other low tax jurisdictions, particularly the Cayman Islands, because the local company law makes it simple and cost effective to set up and manage companies.

The Glasgow campus alongside other new campus developments in Whippany, New Jersey, and Pune, India, are part of our global strategy to create world-class facilities. Our investment in the Glasgow campus is expected to have around 5,000 employees by 2023. Our investment to construct and fit out the new campus with energy-saving plant, machinery and equipment will attract capital allowances, which provide UK tax relief on some types of capital expenditure. Similarly, when we refurbish our existing high street branches throughout the UK, some of that investment may benefit from capital allowances.",13,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

It is also possible that the interpretation of tax law or generally accepted custom or practice may change over time. ■ Operational tax risk: The risk of unexpected financial cost, for example, additional tax payments, interest or penalties, arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems or human errors resulting in the filing of incorrect tax returns, the late filing of tax returns or the late payment of taxes. ■ Stakeholder perception risk: The risk that an action or decision we take will reduce the trust in our integrity and competence by tax authorities, our regulators, investors or the public, leading to potential financial loss and reputational damage.",14,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Our commitment to information sharing and support for a fair tax system,16,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Approach to tax We fully support global initiatives to promote fairness and to protect the integrity of tax systems through information sharing.,16,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Our commitment to information sharing We cooperate with tax authorities globally to reduce the scope for individuals and companies to evade tax. We do this by fulfilling all of our information sharing obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). CRS requires information relating to customers to be collated and provided to tax authorities who share this information with one another. FATCA is an international standard for the automatic exchange of information relating to US persons. We support the aims of CRS and FATCA and have met all of our 2021 information reporting obligations. Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a key part of the UK government’s plans to become one of the most digitally advanced tax administrations in the world, making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and pay the right amount of tax. We are contributing to making MTD a success as we provide a large amount of information to HMRC such as interest earned by our customers on savings accounts as well as details of remuneration paid as an employer. Furthermore, we have put strong governance procedures in place across our business to enable us to fulfil our disclosure obligations under the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (commonly known as DAC 6) and the OECD’s Mandatory Disclosure Rules. These rules help to combat harmful tax practices by requiring the disclosure to tax authorities of cross- border arrangements which feature certain ‘hallmarks’.",16,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"Our support for a fair tax system Protecting the integrity of tax regimes and improving tax systems continues to be a priority of governments globally as they seek to repair public finances in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognise the challenges of the ‘Digital Economy’ and support the OECD’s new two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Pillar One is focused primarily on changing the way digital businesses are taxed. Pillar One will reallocate a portion of international businesses’ profits to the territories in which their customers are based for taxation purposes. As a regulated financial services business, we expect to be excluded and should not be impacted by Pillar One. Regulated financial services businesses already report, and are taxed on, the profits where their operations are carried out and their customers are based. We support the aims of the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules which will impose a Global Minimum Tax. This will be set at a rate of 15% and is expected to apply to all large multinational businesses from 2023. We welcome the progress that these measures represent in advancing the development of a fair and transparent global tax system.",16,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"Tax evasion is the deliberate and illegal non-payment, or underpayment, of any tax and often involves concealing income or assets from tax authorities. Tax evasion is a crime in the UK and in other countries where we operate. Barclays is committed to only dealing with customer or client assets that have been appropriately declared to the relevant tax authority. Barclays plays a full role in global efforts to combat tax evasion and has worked alongside governments and international organisations, such as the OECD, to support their efforts to combat tax evasion. In the UK, Barclays is an active member of the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), a public-private partnership between law enforcement agencies and the financial sector to share and analyse real time intelligence about money laundering (including tax evasion) risks.",17,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Barclays is subject to the provisions of the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 which introduced a corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion in relation to UK and foreign taxes. We do not engage in tax evasion and do not provide products or services with the aim of facilitating tax evasion by others. We also take a zero tolerance approach to any person acting for us or on our behalf who helps customers evade tax in any country. The measures we have in place to prevent this include: ■ training designed for all staff on tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation ■ enhanced due diligence procedures for higher risk customers and third parties ■ specific tax evasion ‘red flags’ to help staff identify potential tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation cases ■ assessment and oversight of tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation risk managed through our financial crime risk management framework and related governance.,17,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"■ In the UK, this involves maintaining a professional and constructive relationship with HMRC. We have regular meetings with HMRC to discuss their enquiries and material issues in relation to our tax affairs. This helps focus both our and HMRC’s resources on the most important issues. ■ As a large group, we make hundreds of filings to HMRC every year, and aim to make all of these on time. We also aim to make these tax filings as clear as possible and include explanations as required to ensure that our returns are easy to understand. ■ Where we face significant uncertainty in relation to the application of tax law, we may seek to agree with HMRC how the tax law should apply. Any agreements have not provided any advantage to us as they have not resulted in any tax treatment that would not be available to other taxpayers. ■ In the rare instances that we ultimately need to have recourse to the Courts to resolve tax issues, we continue to interact with HMRC in a constructive and helpful manner.",18,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"In this risk assessment we considered the following: ■ Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclays’ internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations. ■ Enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to: – detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and – the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working. ■ The Group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels. ■ Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries.

"Various factors mean that the profit we report as being earned in the UK differs from the profits on which we are subject to UK corporation tax. In particular, being a UK-headquartered bank, the profit figure includes dividends received from overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxed in the UK as they have already been taxed in the jurisdiction in which those profits were earned. A large part of our accounting profits reported as earned in the UK in 2021, were made up of dividends received from our overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxable under UK law. In addition, the tax treatment and accounting treatment of various expenses differ, for example Additional Tier 1 coupons and cash contributions to our main UK pension fund.",22,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"Note 1 – Basis of preparation The CBCR Information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared based on the requirements of the Capital Requirements (Country- by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 as interpreted by the directors of the Company. The CBCR Information does not constitute the Company’s statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Statutory accounts for 2020 have been delivered to the registrar of companies, and those for 2021 will be delivered in due course. The auditor has reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under s498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
The table provides the following information for Barclays in 2021:,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Country: In most cases, we have determined which country to report activity under by looking at the country of tax residence. Where activities are conducted by entities that are not themselves subject to tax (for example certain partnerships), then we have considered other factors such as the location of management and employees, the jurisdiction in which the majority of revenues are generated, and the country of establishment of the entity’s parent company. In these cases, it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one where profits, upon which the tax is paid, are reported.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Commentary: We have explained the nature of our activities in each country. That disclosure is included within the commentary column in the table above together with our explanation of any matters of interest.,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Tax contribution,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Turnover: Turnover gives an indication of the size of our business in each country, and we have ordered the table in descending order. Turnover includes net interest income, net fee and commission income, net trading income, net investment income, net premiums from insurance contracts and net claims and benefits incurred on insurance contracts. Some of the turnover numbers need to be treated with care as technical accounting requirements applicable to the way these figures are prepared mean there is an element of double counting. Profits generated in the US and then paid to the UK as a dividend for example, will be included within both the US and UK figures. Adjustments to address this double counting, called intra-group eliminations, are broken down by type (dividends, recharges, hedging and other) at the end of the table and total £5,683m for 2021 in relation to turnover. Additionally, and again to avoid double counting, turnover numbers in each country exclude dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Profit/(loss) before tax: These numbers are accounting profits. As with the turnover figures, these numbers include some double counting which is reconciled at the bottom of the table. Total intra-group eliminations for the profit/(loss) before tax column are £2,840m. In addition, to avoid double counting, profits attributable to dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country are also excluded.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Total tax paid: This column shows the total tax Barclays actually paid in each country in 2021. The following columns break this total down into its constituent parts. Most of the taxes paid in any given year will not relate directly to the profits earned in that year. For example, bank levy is a tax on how we fund ourselves and is paid regardless of whether or not we make any profit.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Approach to tax,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Corporation tax paid: This column records corporation tax actually paid in each country in 2021. Corporation tax payable in any given year is not directly comparable to profits for the same 12-month period. This is because tax on profits is paid across multiple years. In addition, taxable profits are calculated as prescribed by tax law which usually results in differences between accounting and taxable profits. This means it is possible that relatively high corporation tax can be paid when accounting profits are low and vice-versa. The amount of tax paid shown in the financial statements also includes withholding taxes. Withholding taxes comprise the tax charged on dividends or other income received, which is typically paid at the point of distribution from one country to another. We have kept these amounts separate from corporation tax paid by country in the table above.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Employer payroll taxes paid: These are taxes borne by us, based on government social security policies in each country and, for example, in the UK represent employer’s national insurance contributions. They do not represent income tax on payments to our employees or employees’ national insurance contributions which are taxes collected but not borne by us. VAT paid: This includes VAT and other consumption taxes (including goods and services tax, consumption tax and US sales and use taxes). The amounts relate to irrecoverable VAT paid. Unlike many other businesses, financial services businesses are only able to reclaim a small proportion of the VAT they incur, making VAT a significant part of our tax contribution. Not all countries have a VAT system which is why there are no entries against some countries within the table. These numbers do not include any VAT charged to customers on Barclays’ products and services which we collect on behalf of tax authorities.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Country by country data,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Bank levy paid: Bank levy is a tax paid based on the value of certain liabilities on our balance sheet. As with corporation tax, bank levy is paid across multiple years and therefore the tax paid of £241m in 2021 should not be expected to equate to the accounting accrual in 2021. Other: Other taxes are the material property taxes that Barclays paid in 2021 and include, for example, taxes on the property we use in our business such as our network of high street branches. Public subsidies received: Includes only direct support from governments such as government grants. Average number of employees: The number of employees has been calculated as the average number of employees, on a monthly full-time equivalent basis, who were permanently employed by Barclays PLC or one of its subsidiaries during the relevant period. An average of the number of full-time equivalent employees at the end of each calendar month has been calculated. Contractors, agency staff, and staff on extended leave, such as maternity leave, are excluded. Intra-group eliminations: These include adjustments that relate principally to transactions between Barclays businesses in different countries which are included within the individual country turnover, but are then eliminated in determining the overall Barclays Group results to avoid double counting. Intra-group eliminations include dividend payments, income from intra-group transfers of assets, and income arising from hedging transactions that occur at a consolidated Barclays Group level rather than an individual entity level.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Barclays is helping Thai restaurant group Giggling Squid deliver on its expansion ambitions.,28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"After opening their first restaurant in 2009, Andy and Pranee Laurillard felt their existing bank couldn’t provide the necessary expertise or funding to help them keep growing, so they turned to us. Our Corporate Banking team supported with the refinancing of three new restaurants in the Giggling Squid group, and worked with the Laurillards to introduce private equity. With our help, the couple were able to attract an additional £6.4m investment from the Business Growth Fund. Giggling Squid was also named in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100, ranking it as one of the UK’s fastest growing companies, a feat it went on to achieve four years in a row.",28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barclays helped Giggling Squid remain resilient, securing a £5m CBILS loan to provide vital liquidity when it was needed most. We also help them leverage the benefits of digital connectivity – from the integration with our iPortal service, to our ability to power its payment platforms and increase adoption of card payment technology.",28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"This year the business plans to open further sites, growing its presence in the Midlands and North of England.

"■ In 2021, we paid £2,781m of tax globally, of which £1,211m was paid in the UK. This significant contribution to the UK economy reflects the fact that we are a UK-headquartered bank and that the UK is the main base of our global operations. ■ A large amount of the taxes we pay are specific to the UK banking sector. For example, we pay bank levy to the UK Government based on the value of the liabilities on our balance sheet. ■ An additional sector specific tax is the UK banking profits surcharge (an additional 8% tax on top of the standard UK corporation tax rate), which means that UK banks pay tax at 27% on banking profits compared to the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19%. ■ Over the last decade, Barclays has paid over £14bn of taxes in the UK.",9,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
