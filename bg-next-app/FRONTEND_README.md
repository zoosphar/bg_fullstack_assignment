## About The Project

1. Key Functionalities of the UI:
* Optimized Rendering with Server Side Rendering (SSR): The UI seamlessly integrates both client and server side rendering, leveraging Next.js capabilities to enhance user experience and overall website interactivity. SSR ensures faster loading times and improved performance.
* Intuitive Table-Based Data Visualization: Employing Tailwind CSS and ShadCN, the frontend design features a minimalist approach and utilizes table-like components for displaying data. This design choice ensures an intuitive and user-friendly presentation of information.
* Efficient Caching with Next.js: Harnessing the power of Next.js, the UI benefits from out-of-the-box caching mechanisms. This strategic use of caching contributes to enhanced performance, reducing load times and optimizing resource utilization.
* Enhanced Routing System: The UI capitalizes on Next.js page routing, providing a robust and modular structure to the project. This choice not only ensures cleaner code organization but also facilitates seamless navigation and maintenance.

2. The API endpoints the UI uses:
* Sentiment Analysis - /sentiments
* Keyword Extraction - /keywords

3. The key challenges you faced in building the front-end:
* Crafting an intuitive and visually appealing table-like data visualization while effectively presenting complex information demanded careful consideration of user experience (UX) and interface design. Striking the right balance between functionality and simplicity was crucial.

4. How would you improve the front-end, if you had more time to work on it:
* Add a file upload feature or a text input to let the users drop their custom PDF files to get keywords and sentiments out of their own data.
* Explore and implement advanced data visualization techniques, such as interactive charts or graphs, to convey complex information more intuitively.
* Integrate visualization libraries like Charts.js or D3.js for dynamic and customizable visual representations of data.
* Transform the application into a Progressive Web App to enable offline access, push notifications, and enhanced performance, providing a more app-like experience for users.
* Fine-tune and extend responsive design to accommodate a broader range of devices and screen sizes.
* Utilize Playwright for testing.
